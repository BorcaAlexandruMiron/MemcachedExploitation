It's a tool created for memcached exploitation, on LAN/WAN, used for DOS/DDOS amplification as POC, inspired by Memcrashed-DDoS-Exploit, with aditional smart local scanning and nmap memcached-info script, plus shodan Free account level search.

pip install python-nmap   
```

# Info:
For local scanning the memcached port on the vulnerable machine should be oppened (on lattest vesrsions the port is closed by default).
You can check by running:

sudo nmap -targetip- -p 11211
```
Or by running:
```
sudo netstat -plunt 
```
on the memcached hosting machine
