# Mitigation
It's a tool designed to mitigate MemcachedExploit.py, using iptables for blacklisting the source ip of the attackers.
It also contains some iptable management features.
# Required:
- scapy
```
pip install scapy
```
# Info:
It only works with the crafted payload of MemcachedExploit.py, made as a POC.
